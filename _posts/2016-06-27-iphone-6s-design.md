  iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus take everything that made the previous-generation
  iPhone great, and advance it to a new level. They're made with 7000 Series
  aluminum, the strongest alloy we've ever used in an iPhone. They both feature
  Retina HD displays made from the strongest cover glass used on any smartphone
  in the world.
